# Admin Signup Fixes - Changelog

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Duplicate Phone Field**
**Problem:** Phone number field appeared twice when selecting Admin role
- Once in the general section (marked optional)
- Once in the Admin section (marked required)

**Fix:**
- Updated condition to show optional phone field only for Parent role
- Student, Faculty, and Admin roles now have phone in their specific sections only

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before:
{!(roleType === RoleType.STUDENT || roleType === RoleType.FACULTY) && (...)}

// After:
{roleType === RoleType.PARENT && (...)}
```

### **Issue 2: Missing City in Institution Model**
**Problem:** Admin signup collected `institutionCity` but Institution model didn't have a city field
- Data was stored only in AdminProfile
- Institution table had no city column
- City wasn't visible when viewing institution details

**Fix:**
- Added `city` field to Institution model
- Created database migration
- Updated backend controller to save city during institution creation
- Updated seed script to include city

**Database Changes:**
```prisma
// Before:
model Institution {
  id         Int
  publicId   String
  name       String
  type       InstitutionType
  board      String?
  // No city field!
}

// After:
model Institution {
  id         Int
  publicId   String
  name       String
  type       InstitutionType
  city       String?          // ✅ NEW!
  board      String?
}
```

## 🎯 Data Flow

### **When Admin Signs Up:**
```javascript
Frontend Payload:
{
  user: { fullName, email, password, roleType: "ADMIN" },
  institution: {
    type: "SCHOOL",
    name: "Springfield High School",
    city: "Mumbai, Maharashtra"  // ✅ Sent to backend
  },
  profile: {
    kind: "admin",
    data: {
      institutionName: "Springfield High School",
      institutionCity: "Mumbai, Maharashtra",  // ✅ Also stored here
      designation: "Principal",
      phone: "9876543210"
    }
  }
}

Backend Processing:
1. Creates Institution with city
2. Creates AdminProfile with institutionCity
3. Links user to institution
```

### **When Faculty/Student Signs Up:**
```javascript
Frontend Payload:
{
  user: { fullName, email, password, roleType: "FACULTY" },
  institution: {
    type: "SCHOOL",
    name: "Springfield High School",
    city: null  // Not provided by faculty/students
  },
  profile: { ... }
}

Backend Processing:
1. Searches for existing institution by name
2. If found: Links to existing (with city from admin)
3. If not found: Creates new without city
```
