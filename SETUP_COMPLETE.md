## 🔐 Important Notes

### Email Configuration
Your email is already configured in `.env`:
```
SMTP_USER=abubakar.jawed@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=fnzm************
```

### Invite Codes
For testing non-Parent signups, you need to create invite codes in the database. For now:
- **Parent role:** No invite code required ✅
- **Other roles:** Need valid invite code in database

### Creating Test Invite Code (Optional)
Run this in MySQL to create a test invite code:

```sql
USE attendance_db;

-- Get next sequence for invite
INSERT INTO Sequence (model, next) VALUES ('invite', 2)
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE next = next + 1;

-- Create test invite
INSERT INTO Invite (publicId, code, allowedRoles, maxUses)
VALUES ('INV000001', 'TEST123', '["STUDENT","FACULTY","ADMIN"]', 100);
```

Now you can use invite code: `TEST123`

## 🧪 Testing Parent Signup (No Invite Code)

**Test Parent Account:**
1. Select Role: Parent
2. Fill form (no invite code needed!)
3. Click "Send OTP"

- Check SMTP credentials in `.env`
- Verify Gmail App Password is correct
- Check internet connection
